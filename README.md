# GLMs: Multinomial and Poisson Regression, and the Proportional Odds Model

This report will explore 3 generalized linear models (GLM) for the analysis of categorical data: multinomial regression for multiclass classification, Poisson regression for analyzing count d\
ata, and the proportional odds model for modeling cumulative probability distribution of a multiclass outcome. We will perform exploratory data analysis, extensive model exploration and selec\
tion, and inference. We will study cereal placement and its success as a marketing strategy, and predictors for alcohol consumption.

Data is taken from Chris Bilder's Textbook:

Bilder, Christopher R., and Thomas M. Loughin. Analysis of Categorical Data with R. CRC Press, 2015.
